Implementation of Offline Reinforcement Learning in Gym Mini-Grid Environment

### Note:
* The baseline cql implementation given in this repository is similar to [CQL](https://github.com/lcswillems/torch-rl).
* Gym Mini-Grid environment is adapted from [gym-minigrid](https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid).
* Original Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04779.pdf).
